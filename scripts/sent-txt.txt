and contemplated his sad fate .
and the next he sleeps .
i know quite well what you want me to do ,
but this time the old man answered ,

and so was her voice ,
of his little bell , and taking it out of his pocket he rang it once .

but returned very soon and said ,

and determined to lay siege
but the dragons had noticed their flight , and woke their brother out of his year s sleep .

no , i do not know where the dragon lives .
and to make good cheer wherever she was .
i see , replied sister anne ,
the old king is mean, old and ugly said the princess to his nurse - i will never love him.

and his horse had died of exhaustion , while he himself had suffered much from want and misery ,

and would like to enter her service .

and that he was a mighty civil gentleman .
i will put you on my horse and lead you home .

in rallying and joking with each other .

there she sat till the bottom of the chair came out, and down came she, plump upon the ground.
you sit alone in your room and do an online iq test. according to the results, you are among the 5 percent smartest people!
the wicked witch your lives did take the wicked witch , the cunning snake .
i do not know ,
and begged his pardon
they ran through all the rooms , closets , and wardrobes ,
my charming prince, i m so happy to see you at last - cried the princess.
then he took out his little bell and rang it twice .
not being able to bear the thoughts of marrying a man
to which the flower queen s daughter
wherein i have my best furniture ;
there s nothing but what you may expect
please don t kill me - cried the rabbit - i might be useful to you in future!
the gate was opened , and presently entered two horsemen ,
and with such excessive haste that she had twice or thrice
coming to the closet door ,
but the temptation was so strong
as to have a blue beard ,
be disobedient .
and the king and queen were overjoyed when they saw their children , and they all lived happily together in the beautiful palace .
and nobody ever knew what became of them .
to beware of evil counsellors , and especially to be on her guard against strange women .
to find the mare who has hidden herself in a hill .
a young prince was riding one day through a meadow that stretched for miles in front of him ,
sharp is the knife , to take our life ; the fire is hot , now boils the pot , and so we wake , and lie and quake .
and the poor afflicted wife
wandered round the pond in a distracted manner ,
and then she cried ,
sister anne , dost thou not see anyone coming ?
alas ! no , my dear sister ,
the distressed wife came down , and threw herself at his feet , all in tears ,
he put the same question to him as he had put to his son and grandson ;
the poor lady ,
and near it laid three eggs , out of which there came one morning
began to think the master of the house not to have a beard so very blue ,
oh, my steed, - exclaimed the prince, - i did not know that you can speak!
the ladies you saw there .
as they strutted about on the green banks of the pond .
the prince begged for a foal of the mare ,
but the young ones did not listen to their mother , and , playing about the garden one day , they strayed close up to the castle windows .
and hang a large kettleful of water over it .
in the meantime the two little ducklings had fallen asleep , and the little drake lay between them , covered up by their wings ,
but the little drake could not go to sleep ,
muttered the witch to herself ; and she walked up and down in the passage , and then came back to the door , and said :
and again the little drake answered for his sisters :
so she opened the door gently , and seeing the two little ducklings sound asleep ,
looking for her little ones ;
and the white duck brought the little creatures up ,
and will summon all the foxes of the world together
that he meant to set the daughter of the flower queen free , and intended setting out
na
na
into the two great rooms , where was the best and richest furniture ; they could not sufficiently admire the number and beauty of the tapestry ,
the king was so angry that he locked his daughter in the highest tower in the castle.
you are going to work by bus. suddenly, a big guy jumps up. he starts yelling and threatens everybody.
he desired of her
nobody went to bed , but all passed the night
and ground her teeth with anger ;
they are not asleep yet ,
the little princess could not bear the thought of kissing the ugly cold frog.
and there , laid out on the marble floor of the court ,
swim henceforth , white duck !
that he had been deceived ,
each day the girl had to go down to the dark dungeons all alone.
to hold no intercourse with strangers ,
she there and then killed them .
her appearance was a great shock to the prince ,
she called and she searched , but could find no trace of them .
no , i think not ,
when she felt a great shove on her shoulders ,
what do you mean ?
so great was their impatience to see all the rich furniture of her house ,
it was unworthy of me to break my word, father - said the princess - i promise not to do this again.
i think i ll go in
you meet with your best friend in a restaurant. you friend tells you that she lost her job.
you shall go in ,
the dragon lives up there on the mountain ,
when seven dragons rushed on him and asked him what he wanted ?
in the castle beyond the garden , adding ,
the white knight has won the tournament and was pronounced the best champion of the kingdom.
she has ruined me , and she will do her best to ruin you .
was in reality a wicked witch , who envied the queen her good fortune ,
and the witch herself assumed the form of the queen ,
a kind , homely looking old body ,
a soft cushion on which they might sleep .
to be kept warm under their feathers .
all the brightness outside would help to drive away your cares ,
and decked herself out
and instantly the duck fluttered down into his hands .
containing some drops from the spring of healing .
to soothe her with words of comfort and counsel ,
through which no one could force a way .
these will help you if you are in any difficulty .
he noticed an eagle flying over his head .
then he suddenly bethought him
sank at his feet .
the toy teddy bear felt sad and lonely sitting there all alone on the shelf in the shop.
a cloak made of copper ,
here , too , was the flower queen s beautiful daughter .
she was very sad and lonely ,
letting salt tears drop on her work , an old woman ,
you should not mope all day in your rooms ,
we wake and weep ,
we cannot sleep , we wake and weep ,
instead of remaining all day in this room ?
you have a heated discussion with a good friend. a third friend joins in and confirms that your point of view is the correct one.
and in his great joy the king did not know
dead and stone cold ,
their little bodies with her wings ,
you are on a boat trip with your friend. suddenly she screams out and becomes very pale. in a moment, however, she says she is fine.
i gave you always of the best ; i kept you warm in my soft nest .
but , though they ran to and fro ,
was not his own dear wife ,
and looking at him with dying eyes , desired him to afford her one little moment to recollect herself .
you were resolved to go into the closet , were you not ?
but i lost my way in the dark ,
would that you had never been slain .
they were forced to part ,
bitter were the tears she shed , while her husband sought in vain
you must die , madam ,
to several wives ,
cried out as loud as he could bawl to his wife : come down instantly , or i shall come up to you .
come down quickly ,
will you not come down ?
from my just anger and resentment .
then , taking hold of her hair with one hand , and lifting up the sword with the other , he was going to take off her head .
recommend thyself to god , and was just ready to strike . . .
who , drawing their swords , ran directly to blue beard .
having very attentively considered it ,
how comes this blood upon the key ?
are the keys of the two great wardrobes ,
and caught gold fish , and hopped upon the bank and waddled about , ruffling their feathers and saying quack , quack
and the queen promised faithfully
and in thinking of her royal husband .
little ones , are you asleep ?
little ones , are you asleep ?
and , throwing her arms round the king s neck ,
once upon a time a great and powerful king married a lovely princess .
my dear husband ,
and from the little dead bodies three lovely children arose .
which made him so frightfully ugly
ran away from him .
they would neither of them have him ,
who had a blue beard , and what besides gave them disgust and aversion
on which lay the bodies of several dead women ,
that evil had befallen them , and she fluttered up out of the water and flew to the palace .
you are alone at home having breakfast. suddenly, a squirrel jumps into the kitchen through the open window.
the girl answered the king sadly - a evil witch turned my brother into a goat
since i must die ,
why shouldn t i bathe in that cool , fresh water ? no harm could come of it .
give them a sign to make haste .
i loved and watched you day and night you were my joy , my one delight .
i see nothing
and always came back to the spot where her children lay ,
quack , quack my little loves ! quack , quack my turtle doves !
first she stole my king away , then my children did she slay .
his wife did all she could to convince him she was extremely glad
not daring to come while her husband was there , because of his blue beard , which frightened them .
but with such a trembling hand that he easily guessed what had happened .
the poor wife was almost as dead as her husband ,
she made a stop for some time , thinking upon her husband s orders ,
what unhappiness might attend her if she was disobedient ;
and opened it , trembling ,
was all covered over with clotted blood ,
ranged against the walls .
she should have died for fear ,
was stained with blood , she tried two or three times to wipe it off ,
i must certainly have left it above upon the table ,
she was forced to bring him the key .
that the woman he held in his arms
but the witch answered ,
but though the servants chased and chevied , they could not get rid of the duck ; for she circled round and round ,
and as the king heard her words he began to suspect
the duck always fled past them , and would not let herself be caught .
so the king himself stepped down amongst them ,
and he recognised his dear wife .
and it happened that one day
and , pretending to be very kind
why are you sad and cast down , fair queen ?
and as he lay there wide awake in the night
what a wonder is this ?
but before their honeymoon was over
that a bottle would be found
two little fluffy ducklings and a little ugly drake .
warning her ,
ever were seen .
became mistress of all his estate .
to a young gentleman who had loved her a long while ;
to marry herself to a very worthy gentleman ,
and look if my brothers are not coming over ;
there was a man who had fine houses , both in town and country , a deal of silver and gold plate , embroidered furniture , and coaches gilded all over with gold .
cried out from time to time : anne , sister anne ,
one of rapunzel s tears fell on prince s face and he could see again.
one moment longer , if you please ,
dost thou see anybody coming ?
i am coming ,
to obey her royal lord and master
kissed him .
no couple were ever so happy ;
who has been captured by a dragon .
mighty well , madam ;
and take your place among
i give you ,
these open my strong boxes , which hold my money , both gold and silver ; these my caskets of jewels ; and this is the master key to all my apartments .
which were all so fine and rich
no , no , said he ,
to extol and envy the happiness of their friend ,
one a dragoon , the other a musketeer ,
it is your birthday. you are working at your desk in the office. your colleagues come to congratulate you and give you a very nice present.
she was changed into a beautiful woman ,
swim henceforth , white duck !
whose feathers were all of pure gold .
because you have a kind heart and are willing to share what you have
don t forget there is to be a christening to day ;
so they celebrated the wedding
suddenly, there was beautiful music to hear and the fairy queen stepped out of a tree.
you are alone at home looking through a photo album. one of the pictures reminds you about a very embarrassing episode of your life.
you are alone at home late in the evening. you have just watched a horror movie. someone knocks at your door.
she called and she searched ,
but before their honeymoon was over
his mother gave him a fine rich cake and a bottle of wine ,
you are alone at home having breakfast. suddenly, a squirrel jumps into the kitchen through the open window.
he marched before the princess with his goose and its appendages ,
come out and fight like a real man - roared the ogre.
when she felt a great shove on her shoulders ,
and at last in despair sat down on a big stone and contemplated his sad fate .
to be kept warm under their feathers .
well , you may come with me , and i will take you to the mother dragon .
your working late alone. on the desk next to where you are sitting there is a smelly box. you open it. there is a old molded sandwich inside!
by running after a young fellow through the fields like that ? do you call that proper behaviour ?
and listened to her smooth , flattering words .
and order them to catch the mare and bring her to you .
than she stuck fast to her .
who could , he felt sure , help him ;
i ve only got a cinder cake and some sour beer ,
and was determined to ruin her .
wife , what a wonder is this ?
he flew into a terrible rage when he heard what had happened , and determined to lay siege to the flower queen s palace ;
the boy confessed that he had lost the real ring and gave his mother a fake one.
but again the king tried to make some evasion , and demanded a ship which could sail on land or water !
chase that duck out of the courtyard .
no , i do not know where the dragon lives .
my charming prince, i m so happy to see you at last - cried the princess.
we will eat you up .
and making a most woeful face the while .
made all sorts of objections ,
addressed the queen in friendly , flattering tones , saying :
had pushed her into the deep water ,
a kind , homely looking
perhaps when you have hurt yourself , you may learn to know better .
and in spite of it
he had roamed round the world for a whole year , and his horse had died of exhaustion , while he himself had suffered much from want and misery , but still he had come on no trace of her he was in search of .
if i give you my cake and wine i shall have none left for myself ;
and this i will help you to do .
there is nothing wonderful in a duck s quacking .
for shame , you bold girls !
you are alone at home watching tv. they report a fire in the area where a friend of yours lives. in worry, you call her number. she is safe and everything is okay.
when the flower queen s daughter went back again to her mother .
your friend is making tea for you two. suddenly, she breaks you all-favorite porcelain cup that you inherited from your grandma.
if i m not to die of starvation .
how she had managed to get there .
but the dragons had noticed their flight , and woke their brother out of his year s sleep .
the ugliest woman under the sun , and , added to it all , she had three heads .
than they stuck on too ,
plenty to eat ,
you sit alone in your room and do an online iq test. according to the results, you are among the 5 percent smartest people!
the king was so angry that he locked his daughter in the highest tower in the castle.
you are the best fool i ve had at my court for years - chuckled the king.
and so we wake , and lie and quake .
the magician spoke a spell over the prince and all his wounds healed.
as to what this wonderful bird could be ,
why have you come here ?
but if you wish to enter my service , you must first lead my mare out to the meadow and look after her for three days ; but if you don t bring her home safely every evening ,
letting salt tears drop on her work ,
i ve eaten up a whole oven full of loaves ,
was not his own dear wife ,
you are visiting you mom for dinner. accidentally you push your mom???s favorite plate off the table. the plate breaks and its contents are all over the floor.
these will help you if you are in any difficulty .
i am the strongest person in the world, i can kill seven with one blow - said the brave tailor.
in summer .
but again she vanished before his eyes .
and the white duck brought the little creatures up ,
because you were kind and merciful to me .
we wake and weep ,
that no one could ever manage to make her laugh .
her fingers seemed to stick fast to the goose ,
bitter were the tears she shed , while her husband sought in vain to soothe her
and he recognised his dear wife .
each day the girl had to go down to the dark dungeons all alone.
cold water doesn t suit me at all .
then the prince rode home to the old mother dragon ,
with great rejoicings ; and after the king s death
i am a very poor woman , and soon after midnight
where he found the third old man .
to his astonishment he found an old woman ,
was in reality a wicked witch , who envied the queen her good fortune ,
oh, my steed, - exclaimed the prince, - i did not know that you can speak!
the prince begged for a foal of the mare ,
and so we wake , and lie and quake .
but what is one drop on a hot stone ?
but the king felt vexed at the idea of a stupid fellow whom people called dullhead
all made of gold with diamond windows .
why should not i be there too ?
and ground her teeth with anger ;
and was much surprised to see the parson following the footsteps of three girls . why , where is your reverence going so fast ?
the poor white duck swam up and down the pond ;
who is galloping about among the clouds .
you should not mope all day in your rooms ,
in order to sell my eggs in the market on the following morning ;
often she was very sad and lonely ,
you just go your own way ;
that he had been speaking to a good fairy ,
to keep off ,
that at last his father said : very well , then go .
which deserves to be rewarded .
you are alone at home watching a documentary, a character you like very much dies.
and there disappeared hut and all , as though the earth had swallowed her up .
he came to a hut ,
you are going to work by bus. suddenly, a big guy jumps up. he starts yelling and threatens everybody.
thank god, you are back safe and sound, my children - said the mother.
and placing her in front of him on his horse , the prince and she flew like the wind till they reached the flower queen s dwelling .
we cannot sleep , we wake and weep ,
and in thinking of her royal husband .
they are not asleep yet ,
you are a mighty prince ,
and in one day
who did not much fancy him as a son in law ,
the prince sought for her in vain ,
on the third day the prince led the mare to the meadow again ; but once more she vanished before his eyes .
with a most dismal expression of face .
carrying off his daughter ,
the girl answered the king sadly - a evil witch turned my brother into a goat
she led him to the ball room .
till he drank up the whole contents of the cellar
and over and above ,
the wicked witch your lives did take the wicked witch , the cunning snake .
to see him safe and sound ,
a goose ,
he found it had turned into a fine rich cake , and the sour beer into excellent wine .
dead and stone cold , were her three children .
i brought you up with grief and pain ,
here , servants !
a cloak made of gold ,
a young prince was riding one day through a meadow that stretched for miles in front of him ,
i have heard so much of your beauty and kindness , that i would very much like to enter your service .
to find a man who could eat a mountain of bread .
and intended setting out on the following day into the wide world in search of the maid .
we will fly away together .
you are a brave youth , and i will make you my body servant .
who has been captured by a dragon .
the toy teddy bear felt sad and lonely sitting there all alone on the shelf in the shop.
and she will do her best to ruin you .
his mother only gave him a very plain cake made with water and baked in the cinders , and a bottle of sour beer .
through which no one
over there , at the edge of the forest in the little hut you see in the distance ,
dullhead bethought him of the little grey man ,
i loved and watched you day and night you were my joy , my one delight .
you are on a boat trip with your friend. suddenly she screams out and becomes very pale. in a moment, however, she says she is fine.
you are at a bar. a friend you haven t seen for a while tells you that she is now doing skydiving and ice climbing.
she has ruined me ,
i have heard so much of the beauty and kindness of the dragon s mother , and would like to enter her service .
sharp is the knife , to take our life ; the fire is hot , now boils the pot ,
the king did not know
please don t kill me - cried the rabbit - i might be useful to you in future!
the flower queen s daughter .
and fell into this deep ditch ,
keep off !
they could not get rid of the duck ;
but this time the old man answered , the dragon lives up there on the mountain ,
the little princess could not bear the thought of kissing the ugly cold frog.
where i might have remained for ever but for your kindness .
you sit alone in your room at you desk and check e-mail. you have received a 50 percent discount coupon from your travel agency!
then the second son went to the forest ,
at lunch in the canteen you see one of your colleagues who is sitting at the same desk eating something strange looking and very foul smelling.
i gave you always of the best ; i kept you warm in my soft nest .
you are alone at home watching you favorite sitcom on tv. the main character says or does something very funny.
her dress was woven out of the most lovely flowers in the world , and her complexion was like lilies and roses .
o queen .
the white knight has won the tournament and was pronounced the best champion of the kingdom.
and tell them to bring you back the mare ,
it was unworthy of me to break my word, father - said the princess - i promise not to do this again.
and led his beautiful bride home , where the wedding was held with great pomp and magnificence .
we cannot sleep ,
and now before my eyes you re slain .
on a warlike expedition to a far country , and leave his young wife alone at home .
after a time they all came to a town where a king reigned whose daughter was so serious and solemn
two peasants were coming from their work with their hoes .
sharp is the knife , to take our life ; the fire is hot , now boils the pot ,
that the water in the pond looks very cool and inviting .
but a wicked witch .
you are enjoying an evening in a good company. a good friend of yours says or does something very funny.
i will put you on my horse and lead you home . where do you live ?
changed me , from a happy wife , to a duck for all my life .
and i will give you something .
but the wicked witch was taken by the king s command ,
one of rapunzel s tears fell on prince s face and he could see again.
they were forced to part ,
you meet with your best friend in a restaurant. you friend tells you that she lost her job.
here , too , was the flower queen s beautiful daughter .
and , pretending to be very kind
the eldest thought to herself : no doubt i shall soon find a good opportunity
whatever i give to you i deprive myself of .
the toy teddy bear felt sad and lonely sitting there all alone on the shelf in the shop.
the king was so angry that he locked his daughter in the highest tower in the castle.
you are alone at home late in the evening. you have just watched a horror movie. someone knocks at your door.
your working late alone. on the desk next to where you are sitting there is a smelly box. you open it. there is a old molded sandwich inside!
suddenly, there was beautiful music to hear and the fairy queen stepped out of a tree.
yes , i will sell it for nothing less ,
you are alone at home looking through a photo album. one of the pictures reminds you about a very embarrassing episode of your life.
i hope that this , at least , is not real ?
and was sneered and jeered at and snubbed on every possible opportunity .
the boy confessed that he had lost the real ring and gave his mother a fake one.
you are alone at home watching tv. they report a fire in the area where a friend of yours lives. in worry, you call her number. she is safe and everything is okay.
come out and fight like a real man - roared the ogre.
i have done all this for you because you were kind and merciful to me .
he had a wretched little room close to the pigsties ;
he must be a most accomplished swineherd !
and then he threw one of his slippers at their heads
but we don t at all like being kissed by him ,
we know who is going to have porridge and sausages isn t it interesting ? yes , very interesting !
and in one day it had all vanished .
but what s the good of that to anyone who is as hungry as i am ?
he found it had turned into a fine rich cake , and the sour beer into excellent wine .
heaven forbid !
for he was very angry .
and making a most woeful face the while .
i have eaten and i have drunk for you , and now i will give you the ship .
there she sat till the bottom of the chair came out, and down came she, plump upon the ground.
i don t know how i am ever to quench this terrible thirst i am suffering from . cold water doesn t suit me at all .
but for your kindness .
the ladies in waiting danced and clapped their hands . we know who is going to have soup and pancakes ;
i despise you !
be off with you !
but i won t kiss him again .
we will eat you up .
father , let me go out and cut wood .
yes , it is a real bird ,
and drank and drank till he drank up the whole contents of the cellar
the whole night and the whole day the pot was made to boil ;
whose daughter was so serious and solemn that no one could ever manage to make her laugh .
but oh , such a rose !
but that she could play with one finger .
but no sooner had they reached the grass than she vanished .
but the queen caused a forest of flowers as high as the sky
her dress was woven out of the most lovely flowers in the world , and her complexion was like lilies and roses .
each day the girl had to go down to the dark dungeons all alone.
no doubt i shall soon find a good opportunity to pluck out one of its feathers ,
i declare my stomach feels quite empty , and i must draw my belt tight if i m not to die of starvation .
ten kisses from the princess , or else i keep my pot .
who could eat a mountain of bread .
he wants a hundred kisses from the princess ,
thank god, you are back safe and sound, my children - said the mother.
you had better leave it alone ; you know nothing about it .
he had made a pretty little pot .
then at once one could smell what dinner was ready in any fire place in the town .
it is your birthday. you are working at your desk in the office. your colleagues come to congratulate you and give you a very nice present.
oh , no , of course we won t !
the prince and she flew like the wind
you are at a bar. a friend you haven t seen for a while tells you that she is now doing skydiving and ice climbing.
the young couple lived happily together till winter came ,
my charming prince, i m so happy to see you at last - cried the princess.
he was turning aside to avoid it ,
i will summon all the eagles of the air together , and order them to catch the mare and bring her to you .
your friend is making tea for you two. suddenly, she breaks you all-favorite porcelain cup that you inherited from your grandma.
what do you mean by running after a young fellow through the fields like that ?
but he was nothing daunted .
you are alone at home watching football game with your favorite team. suddenly, the other team scores a goal and your team loses.
tell him he shall have , as before , ten kisses ; the rest he can take from my ladies in waiting .
and heaven prosper your undertaking .
the girl answered the king sadly - a evil witch turned my brother into a goat
why have you come here ?
they were filled with curiosity as to what this wonderful bird could be ,

i know quite well what you want me to do ,
you would have nothing to do with a noble prince ;

i am a very poor woman ,
a young prince was riding one day through a meadow that stretched for miles in front of him , when he came to a deep open ditch .
you are alone at home having breakfast. suddenly, a squirrel jumps into the kitchen through the open window.
and married he wished to be .
i am the strongest person in the world, i can kill seven with one blow - said the brave tailor.
where he found a castle all made of gold with diamond windows .
you have a kind heart , which deserves to be rewarded .
who has been captured by a dragon .
my son ,
alas , what an unhappy creature i am !
the prince thanked him for his information ,

and at last reached the hut where he found the third old man .
then let the bird fly away ,
whom people called dullhead

who begged him for a morsel of cake and a draught of wine .
but if you care to have that , let us sit down and eat .
you will see the king of the fishes
i know already what you want ,
what can that commotion be by the pigsties ?
the king of the foxes will come to you ;
and told his father that he meant to set the daughter of the flower queen free ,
it is not artificial , it is real !
and walked through twelve splendid halls , all made of gold and diamonds .
you did not understand the rose or the nightingale , but you could kiss the swineherd for the sake of a toy . this is what you get for it !
ugh !
he asked him the same question , and the old man answered , no , i do not know where the dragon lives .
the flower queen s daughter .
both your brothers have injured themselves .
ah , yes ,
but what shall i give you as a reward to begin with ?
the prince lifted her on to his horse , and soon they reached the hut , where the old woman got down , and turning to the prince said , just wait a moment , and i will give you something .
oh, my steed, - exclaimed the prince, - i did not know that you can speak!
you are a brave youth , and i will make you my body servant .
driving the mare before them .
and there disappeared hut and all , as though the earth had swallowed her up .
i am the emperor s daughter !
it is real !
keep off ! for heaven s sake , keep off !
he dismounted from his horse , and stepped along in the direction the sound came from .
he found an old woman , who begged him to help her out of the ditch .
and will summon all the foxes of the world together to find the mare who has hidden herself in a hill .
she clapped her hands for joy . if only it were a little pussy cat ! she said .
it is charming !
and at the end of it came to the little hut ,
the swineherd .
in front of which sat a very old man .
and her face beamed with joy , for she also could play where is augustus dear ?
the white knight has won the tournament and was pronounced the best champion of the kingdom.
that is very tiresome !
because you have a kind heart and are willing to share what you have with others .
the old king is mean, old and ugly said the princess to his nurse - i will never love him.
it only bloomed every five years ,
were shut up in its little throat .
good day , emperor ,
but the king felt vexed
the younger sister could not imagine why she was to keep off ,
he is disobliging !
and this i will help you to do .
but , lo and behold !
now i will bring you luck ,
yes , said the emperor ; and then he wept like a little child .
you are enjoying an evening in a good company. a good friend of yours says or does something very funny.
they jingled most beautifully and played the old tune where is augustus dear ? alas ! he s not here , here , here !
but you must put yourselves in front of me , so that no one can see .
please don t kill me - cried the rabbit - i might be useful to you in future!
i believe he is mad !
if you wish to marry her , you must first set her free ,
so the next morning the prince mounted his fine horse and left his home .
he heard a rustling sound in the air beside him ,
how much the bird reminds me of the musical snuff box of the late empress !
you meet with your best friend in a restaurant. you friend tells you that she lost her job.
her fingers seemed to stick fast to the goose , and she could not take her hand away .
i have never heard a more beautiful composition .
you are on a boat trip with your friend. suddenly she screams out and becomes very pale. in a moment, however, she says she is fine.
is the daughter of the queen of the flowers ,
by your side . these will help you if you are in any difficulty .
they just had to run after him right or left as best they could .
but the wife had walked far , and was very tired , and strive as she would , she fell sound asleep .
he may be the cook , but he did not cook this feast ,
come out and fight like a real man - roared the ogre.
and the hoodie was more angry than before , and went away in a rage .
you have got in your pocket , and let me have a draught of your wine i am so hungry and thirsty .
you are alone at home watching football game with your favorite team. suddenly, the other team scores a goal and your team loses.
and in thinking of her royal husband .
and doing all the work of the house .
it is your birthday. you are working at your desk in the office. your colleagues come to congratulate you and give you a very nice present.
and there , laid out on the marble floor of the court ,
indeed i will not , answered she , an ugly brute is the hoodie .
you are alone at home watching tv. they report a fire in the area where a friend of yours lives. in worry, you call her number. she is safe and everything is okay.
you have not forgotten anything ?
many hours she slept , and the hoodie entered through a window ,
so hard did she work ,
and when they saw the goose
but when at last she was over ,
for the king had to go on a warlike expedition
so when he beheld a woman whom he did not know coming along the street , hope sprang up in him . will you cook the wedding feast in place of me ? he said , and i will pay you well when i return from the race .
wilt thou wed me , farmer s daughter ?
and the man sat down before the huge casks and drank and drank till he drank up
on the same spot
often she was very sad and lonely , and it happened that one day
and the little drake answered for the other two
but he was already flying off , and she only seized a feather from his wing .
do give me a piece of that cake
an ugly brute is the hoodie .
it was only to hear that her husband
dead and stone cold , were her three children .
stealing close towards the house , and every man slept , and the mother slept also .
and when it fell he found amongst its roots a goose , whose feathers were all of pure gold .
i shall soon find a good opportunity
and in his great joy the king did not know that the woman he held in his arms was not his own dear wife ,
that her husband resolved to take her away
on the other side .
full of light straight in front of her ,
was so unhappy
na
you have a heated discussion with a good friend. a third friend joins in and confirms that your point of view is the correct one.
and stopped at the three houses
a woman came out ,
but this clever son replied : if i give you my cake and wine i shall have none left for myself ;
was so serious and solemn that no one could ever managed to make her laugh .
but by the time she had got to the top of the hill ,
the old king is mean, old and ugly said the princess to his nurse - i will never love him.
i think i can help you , said dullhead . come with me , and you shall drink to your heart s content .
and let fall a ring on her hand .
and she hurried towards it as fast as she could .
what do you mean by running after a young fellow through the fields like that ? do you call that proper behaviour ?
sat a man who was drawing in a strap as tight as he could round his body , and making a most woeful face the while .
with her for company .
but should come out into the green garden , and hear the birds sing with joy among the trees , and see the butterflies fluttering above the flowers , and hear the bees and insects hum , and watch the sunbeams chase the dew drops through the rose leaves and in the lily cups .
early one morning
we wake and weep , sharp is the knife , to take our life ; the fire is hot , now boils the pot , and so we wake , and lie and quake .
and in her heart she had a foreboding that evil had befallen them ,
you are the best fool i ve had at my court for years - chuckled the king.
whatever i give to you i deprive myself of .
i don t know how i am ever
but dullhead begged so hard to be allowed to go
now there was to be a race in the town , and everyone meant to be there ,
little ones , are you asleep ?
if they are both there , why should not i be there too ?
adding , she has ruined me ,
instead of remaining all day in this room ?
which was big enough to hold them ,
and some sour beer ,
the spell fell off him ,
she did not know why .
and snubbed on every possible opportunity .
the girl answered the king sadly - a evil witch turned my brother into a goat
but i will help you .
they are not asleep yet ,
his mother only gave him a very plain cake made with water and baked in the cinders , and a bottle of sour beer .
you had better leave it alone ; you know nothing about it .
very well , then go .
perhaps when you have hurt yourself , you may learn to know better .
still , at last they were over , and they went back
who has cooked this feast ?
i am the strongest person in the world, i can kill seven with one blow - said the brave tailor.
said the bridegroom , and then inquiry was made ,
na
and she will do her best to ruin you .
they strayed close up to the castle windows .
you are alone at home having breakfast. suddenly, a squirrel jumps into the kitchen through the open window.
you sit alone in your room at you desk and check e-mail. you have received a 50 percent discount coupon from your travel agency!
my charming prince, i m so happy to see you at last - cried the princess.
but when she reached the small house , the woman bade her keep awake , and if the hoodie flew into the room , to try to seize him .
indeed i will wed thee ; a pretty creature is the hoodie ,
then she looked round for some place to rest in ,
i have something to ask thee ,
still she said nothing of this , and only replied , i would rather thou wert a man by day and a hoodie by night ,
na
the two sisters returned home ,
you are at a bar. a friend you haven t seen for a while tells you that she is now doing skydiving and ice climbing.
you are alone at home watching you favorite sitcom on tv. the main character says or does something very funny.
you are alone at home watching a documentary, a character you like very much dies.
and so he was ;
dullhead asked him what he was taking so much to heart ,
and had not gone very far when the hoodie suddenly said
she dropped the ring and the feather into it , and set it herself before him .
no harm could come of it .
the boy confessed that he had lost the real ring and gave his mother a fake one.
the whole contents of the cellar
to hold no intercourse with strangers ,
to be sure i ve emptied a whole barrel of wine , but what is one drop on a hot stone ?
at lunch in the canteen you see one of your colleagues who is sitting at the same desk eating something strange looking and very foul smelling.
and the girl was summoned to the great hall . that is my married wife ,
i declare my stomach feels quite empty , and i must draw my belt tight if i m not to die of starvation .
we wake and weep ,
because he did not want the hoodie for a son in law .
he would be in the valley
with grief and pain and now before my eyes you re slain . i gave you always of the best ;
then the second son went to the forest ,
greatly he loved races , and sore was his heart to think that one should be run without his seeing it ,
and when the farmer arrived in the morning to see his grandson , he found them all weeping , for while they had slept the baby had vanished .
you shall have my daughter without further delay .
to quench this terrible thirst i am suffering from . cold water doesn t suit me at all .
you are enjoying an evening in a good company. a good friend of yours says or does something very funny.
and a draught from your bottle ; i am so hungry and thirsty .
i ve eaten up a whole oven
you sit alone in your room and do an online iq test. according to the results, you are among the 5 percent smartest people!
oh, my steed, - exclaimed the prince, - i did not know that you can speak!
by and bye they had a son , and very pleased they both were .
she set out for the hill of poison .
in making her laugh
with a most dismal expression of face .
and the first time dullhead happened to leave the room she caught hold of the goose by its wing .
and thought to pluck a golden feather for herself too ;
for she had no idea
just the same answer , muttered the witch ; i think i ll go in and see .
so that he might be sure
and the old woman said to the queen : the day is so warm ,
na
that in a few days she was able to make the horse shoes .
the king was so angry that he locked his daughter in the highest tower in the castle.
and was sneered and jeered at
answered she ,
keep off !
for heaven s sake , keep off !
so he went off to the forest , and on the very spot where he had cut down the tree he saw a man sitting
to have all the flour in his kingdom brought together , and to have a huge mountain baked of it .
but the next moment she regretted her words ,
her husband ;
na
it was unworthy of me to break my word, father - said the princess - i promise not to do this again.
and the sun s rays so scorching , that the water in the pond looks very cool and inviting .
at the first note of music they all fell asleep ,
saying neutral why are you sad and cast down , fair queen ? you should not mope all day in your rooms ,
letting salt tears drop on her work ,
we cannot sleep ,
and the queen promised faithfully
no couple were ever so happy ;
and when the king saw it he felt
when you come sailing in such a ship ,
which could sail on land or water !
it happened that the eldest son
and bade her welcome , and set before her food , and gave her a soft bed to lie on .
so she opened the door gently , and seeing the two little ducklings sound asleep , she there and then killed them .
na
and the wicked witch had pushed her into the deep water , exclaiming : swim henceforth , white duck !
not long after his punishment overtook him , for no sooner had he struck a couple of blows on a tree with his axe , than he cut his leg so badly that he had to be carried home .
you meet with your best friend in a restaurant. you friend tells you that she lost her job.
the girl loved them both , and never wished for things to be different .
where she told the servants to sharpen the knives , and to make a great fire ready , and hang a large kettleful of water over it .
your friend is making tea for you two. suddenly, she breaks you all-favorite porcelain cup that you inherited from your grandma.
happy indeed were they to be together again , and little did they mind that the hill of poison took long to cross , for she had to go some way forwards , and then throw the horse shoes back for him
as to what this wonderful bird could be ,
you are visiting you mom for dinner. accidentally you push your mom???s favorite plate off the table. the plate breaks and its contents are all over the floor.
and near it laid three eggs ,
sharp is the knife , to take our life ; the fire is hot , now boils the pot , and so we wake , and lie and quake .
and amongst its roots you ll find something .
she would see him on a hill top ,
and set food before her , and gave her a soft bed to lie in .
and the witch herself assumed the form of the queen , and decked herself out in the royal robes , and sat among the court ladies , awaiting the king s return .
and the witch hastened forward
come what might , they would not close their eyes ;
however , after a night s rest he was in a better temper ,
the witch at once recognised them by their smell , and ground her teeth with anger ; but she hid her feelings , and , pretending to be very kind
na
na
muttered the witch to herself ; and she walked up and down in the passage ,
two little fluffy ducklings
he has gone over the hill of poison , said she , and there you cannot follow him without horse shoes on your hands and feet .
i kept you warm in my soft nest . i loved and watched you day and night
who had three daughters , and good useful girls they were , up with the sun ,
the girl awoke with a start , and leant forward to grasp him ,
give me a piece of your cake
but their mother used to warn them not to stray too far ,
that a wicked witch lived
full of loaves , but what s the good of that to anyone who is as hungry as i am ?
he made a false stroke with his axe , and cut his own arm so badly that he was obliged to go home and have it bound up .
father , let me go out and cut wood .
a great and powerful king married a lovely princess .
and went further on into the forest .
but the little drake could not go to sleep , and as he lay there wide awake in the night
to pluck out one of its feathers ,
the white knight has won the tournament and was pronounced the best champion of the kingdom.
she burst out laughing , and could not stop herself .
and enjoy myself among the trees and flowers , and the singing birds and fluttering butterflies and humming insects , and look at the dew drops hiding from the sunbeams in the hearts of the roses and lilies , and wander about in the sunshine ,
the girl was surprised at his words , for she did not know that he could be anything but a hoodie at all times .
but in the night soft music was heard
so the king had decreed that whoever should succeed
and he left the little man standing there
was to be married that day to the daughter of a great lord .
what harm would it do if i were to go into the garden for a short time
had fallen asleep ,
and when she reached the valley he was on the top of another hill
bitter were the tears she shed , while her husband sought in vain to soothe her with words of comfort and counsel ,
he heard the witch come to the door and say little ones , are you asleep ?
clear as crystal ,
but scarcely had her tender feet
in order to take their little sons to their own home .
na
the youngest of them was called dullhead ,
and when the sun rose she got up , and left the house ,
he required dullhead to find a man who could eat a mountain of bread .
dullhead was delighted , and said : get up and come with me ,
the girl thanked her ,
except the stranger who had come over the hill of poison
to a far country , and leave his young wife alone at home .
on her hands and feet she went , but even with the horse shoes on she had to be very careful not to stumble , lest some poisoned thorns should enter into her flesh , and she should die .
he lifted it out , carried it off , and took it with him
for long the queen resisted her coaxing words , remembering the promise she had given the king ,
na
na
na
why , where is your reverence going so fast ?
don t forget there is to be a christening today ;
and on the morrow they were married .
with her ladies in her own apartments ,
why shouldn t i bathe in that cool , fresh water ?
because you have a kind heart and are willing to share what you have with others .
after that she watched the seat where the bridegroom was sitting , and taking a plateful of the broth ,
there she sat till the bottom of the chair came out, and down came she, plump upon the ground.
then she left them
they were forced to part ,
then dullhead fell to at once to hew down the tree ,
when dullhead heard this he marched before the princess
for shame , you bold girls !
you are on a boat trip with your friend. suddenly she screams out and becomes very pale. in a moment, however, she says she is fine.
his mother gave him
and she awoke again .
na
na
and , throwing her arms round the king s neck ,
which could sail on land or water ,
the little princess could not bear the thought of kissing the ugly cold frog.
but at last she thought to herself :
gladly she agreed , and cooked the feast in a kitchen
and when dullhead brought out his cake he found it had turned into a fine rich cake , and the sour beer into excellent wine .
each day the girl had to go down to the dark dungeons all alone.
and suddenly the tramp of horses hoofs
i have eaten
with that the little man took leave .
to an inn where he meant to spend the night .
stepped up to the window , and ,leaning upon her crutch ,
but the king felt vexed at the idea of a stupid fellow whom people called dullhead
then they ate and drank ,
now i will bring you luck ,
let us sit down and eat .
he could no longer refuse him his daughter .
we cannot sleep ,
so she sprang to them ;
and again the little drake answered for his sisters
i have done all this for you because you were kind and merciful to me .
and glad she was to see a little house
the toy teddy bear felt sad and lonely sitting there all alone on the shelf in the shop.
and the white duck brought the little creatures up ,

and in her heart she had a foreboding that evil had befallen them,
and suddenly the tramp of horses hoofs was heard, and the barking of dogs,

the princess feared lest jack should kiss her because of his prickles,

the day is so warm, and the sun s rays so scorching, that the water in the pond looks very cool and inviting. would you not like to bathe in it, fair queen?
wife, what a wonder is this? listen to that white duck.
no couple were ever so happy;

she thought she should have died for fear , and the key , which she pulled out of the lock , fell out of her hand .
but matters turned out very differently from what he had expected,
where he had been wandering so long,
where was the best and richest furniture ;
jack tore all the princess s smart clothes off her, and pricked her all over with his bristles, saying:
a great and powerful king married a lovely princess.
the white knight has won the tournament and was pronounced the best champion of the kingdom.
